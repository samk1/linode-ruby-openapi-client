# LinodeOpenapiClient::PostObjectStorageBucketRequest

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **label** | **String** | The name for this bucket.  * A bucket name can contain from 3 to 63 alphanumeric characters, dashes (&#x60;-&#x60;), or dots (&#x60;.&#x60;). * A bucket name can&#39;t end in a dash and you can&#39;t use two consecutive dashes. * A bucket name can&#39;t start or end in a dot, and you can&#39;t use two consecutive dots. As a best practice, only use dots if a certificate you&#39;re using with your bucket requires it. (For example, if you&#39;re using a custom TLS certificate.) * A bucket name needs to be unique in the &#x60;region&#x60; where you&#39;re creating the bucket. The API only reserves labels for the &#x60;region&#x60; where active buckets are created and stored. If you want to reserve this bucket&#39;s label in another &#x60;region&#x60;, create a new bucket with the same label in the new &#x60;region&#x60;. |  |
| **cors_enabled** | **Boolean** | If set to &#x60;false&#x60;, CORS is disabled for all origins in the bucket. For more fine-grained controls of CORS, use the S3 API directly. | [optional][default to true] |
| **acl** | **String** | The Access Control Level of the bucket using a canned ACL string. For more fine-grained control of ACLs, use the S3 API directly. | [optional][default to &#39;private&#39;] |
| **region** | **String** | The &#x60;id&#x60; assigned to the data center ([region](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-regions)) where this Object Storage bucket should be created.  &gt; ðŸ“˜ &gt; &gt; This supports legacy &#x60;clusterId&#x60; values that represented a specific region. For example, &#x60;us-east-1&#x60; is the legacy reference for the &#x60;us-east&#x60; region. | [optional] |
